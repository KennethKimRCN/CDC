                He's the leader of the bunch, you know him well
                He's finally back to kick some tail
                His coconut gun can fire in spurts
                If he shoots ya, it's gonna hurt!
                He's bigger, faster, and stronger too
                He's the first member of the Can't Dance Crew!
                Huh!
            </pre>
            <pre>
                This Kong's got style, so listen up dudes
                She can shrink in size, to suit her mood
                She's quick and nimble when she needs to be
                She can float through the air and climb up trees!
                If you choose her, you'll not choose wrong
                With a skip and a hop, she's one cool Kong!
                Huh!
            </pre>   
            <pre>
                He has no style, he has no grace
                Th-this Kong has a funny face
                He can handstand when he needs to
                And stretch his arms out, just for you
                Inflate himself just like a balloon
                This crazy Kong just digs this tune!
                Huh!
            </pre>
            <pre>
                He's back again and about time too
                And this time he's in the mood
                He can fly real high with his jetpack on
                With his pistols out, he's one tough Kong!
                He'll make you smile when he plays his tune
                But Kremlings beware 'cause he's after you!
                Huh!
            </pre>
            <pre>
                Finally, he's here for you
                It's the last member of the DK crew!
                This Kong's so strong, it isn't funny
                Can make a Kremling cry out for mummy
                Can pick up a boulder with relative ease
                Makes crushing rocks seem such a breeze
                He may move slow, he can't jump high
                But this Kong's one hell of a guy!
